# Devops

The project will be using:
- CI/CD pipelines for development & deployment
- Infrastructure as Code for setting up infrastructure
- Configuration management
- Git tags to release

List of software stacks we'll be using:
- TravisCI for CI/CD
- Terraform for IaC
- Ansible for Configuration Management
- Github for Source code hosting (obviously :P)

However, bear in mind that the list of software stacks may change if I were to explore new tools to gain maximum experience during the development.
