**Status: Under heavy development**

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9166b573-1cee-48eb-89e4-c9b60a47c938/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/yafig/deploys)

Inspired by [Realword project from Thinkster](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld), this project is aimed at the same goal:

> While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build real applications with it.

**YAFIG** is aimed to build an **Instagram-clone** project with a loosely coupled microservice approach. This project is an initiative for me (and other contributors) to learn *in public* by building a real project from scratch. I am pretty sure I have a lot of things to learn along this journey.

The backend part will be implemented in 2 programming languages (or more, PR is open for other languages), Python and Go. Each microservice will be implemented either using Hexagonal architecture, Model View Controller (MVC) architecture or flat-file architecture.

The frontend is implemented in VueJS + NuxtJS (again, PR is open for other JS frameworks).
